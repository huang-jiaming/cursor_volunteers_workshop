      <h1>Daily Standup Notes with Cursor</h1>
      <p>
        I use Cursor to speed up converting rough bullet notes into concise, structured standup
        updates for my team.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Before Cursor</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Collect scattered notes from Slack, terminal history, and sticky notes.</li>
          <li>Rewrite each item manually into clean standup language.</li>
          <li>Reorder items and trim details to fit our meeting format.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>With Cursor</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Paste raw notes into Cursor as context.</li>
          <li>Prompt for a three-part standup update: done, next, blockers.</li>
          <li>Edit only minor wording and post directly.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Prompt I Used</h2>
        <pre><code>Turn these rough bullets into a concise standup update.
Format as:
1) Yesterday
2) Today
3) Blockers
Keep it under 120 words and keep technical details accurate.</code></pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Failure/Bug and Debugging</h2>
        <p>
          The first outputs were too vague and dropped key technical constraints. I fixed this by
          adding explicit instructions: "do not remove file names, ticket IDs, or error messages,"
          and by asking Cursor to verify completeness before finalizing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Measurable Improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Standup prep time dropped from about 18 minutes to 7 minutes per day, saving roughly 55
          minutes each work week.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Next Improvement (Optional)</h2>
        <p>
          Automate note collection into one markdown file before prompting Cursor, so prep becomes
          nearly one-click.
